# MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup>/SimBiology<sup>&reg;</sup> DevOps Workflow Example

This workshop provides hands-on experience using some of MATLAB's powerful software testing and automation features.<br>
It showcases the development of a Web App to simulate a SimBiology model. The App is developed using the [model-view-controller (MVC)](https://www.mathworks.com/company/technical-articles/developing-matlab-apps-using-the-model-view-controller-pattern.html) software architecture pattern and is
based on the workshop [Generating Tests for Your MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> Code](https://github.com/mathworks/Generating-Tests-for-Your-MATLAB-Code-Workshop) developed by [Adam Sifounakis](https://github.com/asifouna).
<br><br>

## About the workshop
This hands-on workshop will guide you through:
* forking your own copy of the "MATLAB-SimBiology-DevOps-Workflow-Example" repository on GitHub
* generating tests using your command history and MATLAB Copilot
* automatically finding and running existing tests
* measuring and exploring code coverage metrics for your code
* identifying missing code coverage and potential bugs that may be exposed with coverage metrics
* automating your testing and results publishing with continuous integration (CI) practices using GitHub Actions

After completing the workshop, you should feel confident using some of MATLAB's software testing features and integrating your code with CI systems!
